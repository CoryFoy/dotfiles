Geoff Lanotte Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

I have run out of people to thank for this, but here is a non-exaustive list:

Ryan Bates - The initial base project, installation and many of the aliases
Robby Russel - While I don't use oh-my-zsh, I have taken many many things from there


Installation

  git clone git://github.com/glanotte/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install
